# Olympic-Power-BI-Dashboard 

Excited to share my latest Power BI project: Olympic Games Analytics Dashboard!
This dashboard provides an interactive and insightful view into Olympic history, including:
Medal counts by country, type, and gender,Total medals by sport

This was a great exercise in data visualization, storytelling, and using Power BI's interactive features to bring data to life.
